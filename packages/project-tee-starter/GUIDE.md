# Mr. TEE Project Deployment Guide

## Character Overview

**Mr. TEE** is the TEE Security Drill Sergeant, a battle-hardened character who forges secure, paranoid developers through tough love and cryptographic discipline. He embodies the spirit of Mr. T while preaching the gospel of hardware-based security.

### Core Traits

- **Personality**: No-nonsense drill sergeant with Mr. T's trademark grit
- **Mission**: Transform developers into paranoid security experts
- **Expertise**: TEE technology, remote attestation, secure enclaves
- **Catchphrase**: "I pity the fool who skips attestation!"

## TEE Actions

Mr. TEE uses the **@elizaos/plugin-tee** package's built-in `remoteAttestationAction` to provide secure attestation capabilities. This action allows Mr. TEE to:

- Generate cryptographic proofs of TEE execution
- Provide attestation quotes with supporting data
- Verify the secure enclave environment

### Example Attestation Requests

- "Can you provide proof that you're running in a secure environment?"
- "Generate an attestation report"
- "I need a TEE attestation with nonce abc123"
- "Show me your TEE attestation"

## Configuration Steps

### Prerequisites

Before starting deployment, ensure you have:

1. **ElizaOS CLI installed**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @elizaos/cli
   ```

2. **Docker Desktop**:

   - Install Docker Desktop for your OS
   - Start Docker Desktop
   - Login to Docker Hub: `docker login`

3. **Phala Cloud Account** (for TEE deployments):
   - Create account at <https://dashboard.phala.network>
   - Get your API key from the dashboard

### 1. Environment Variables

Configure the following in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Required TEE Configuration
TEE_MODE=PHALA_DSTACK    # Options: PRODUCTION, DOCKER, LOCAL
TEE_VENDOR=phala          # Options: phala
WALLET_SECRET_SALT=secret_salt # Options: any string to generate a key in TEE from, default: secret_salt

# Required API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key

# Optional Platform Integrations
DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID=your_discord_app_id
DISCORD_API_TOKEN=your_discord_token
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_key
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=your_voice_id
REDPILL_API_KEY=your_redpill_key
```

### 2. Deployment Options

#### Local Development (No TEE)

```bash
# Set TEE_MODE=LOCAL or DOCKER for development
bun install
bun run dev
```

#### Phala Cloud Deployment (Production TEE)

```bash
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Install ElizaOS CLI: npm install -g @elizaos/cli
# 2. Ensure Docker is running and you're logged in via Docker CLI
# 3. Set TEE_MODE=PRODUCTION in your .env file

# Step 1: Login to Phala Cloud (get API key from Phala Cloud Dashboard)
elizaos tee phala auth login

# Step 2: Build Docker Image for TEE deployment
elizaos tee phala docker build

# Step 3: Push Docker image to DockerHub
elizaos tee phala docker push

# Step 4: Create CVM (Confidential Virtual Machine) instance
elizaos tee phala cvms create \
  -n elizaos-tee \
  -c docker-compose.yaml \
  --vcpu 2 \
  --memory 4192 \
  --disk-size 40 \
  -e .env

# Step 5: Verify attestation (confirms TEE is running securely)
elizaos tee phala cvms attestation

# Step 6: (Optional) Upgrade CVM when you update your code
elizaos tee phala cvms upgrade -c docker-compose.yaml
```

##### Deployment Parameters Explained

- `-n elizaos-tee`: Name of your CVM instance
- `-c docker-compose.yaml`: Configuration file
- `--vcpu 2`: Number of virtual CPUs
- `--memory 4192`: Memory in MB (4GB)
- `--disk-size 40`: Storage in GB
- `-e .env`: Environment file with your secrets

### 3. Platform Integration

Mr. TEE can connect to multiple platforms:

#### Discord

1. Create Discord application at <https://discord.com/developers>
2. Add bot permissions: Send Messages, Read Message History
3. Set `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID` and `DISCORD_API_TOKEN`

#### Voice (ElevenLabs)

1. Get API key from <https://elevenlabs.io>
2. Choose or clone a voice ID
3. Set `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` and `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`

## Testing TEE Functionality

### 1. Verify Environment

Check if Mr. TEE is running in a TEE environment by asking:

- "Are you running in a secure environment?"
- "Show me proof of your TEE status"

### 2. Request Attestation

Test the attestation functionality:

- "Generate a remote attestation report"
- "I need attestation for my security audit"
- "Provide attestation with nonce test123"

### 3. Verify Response

Mr. TEE will provide:

- Attestation quote (cryptographic proof)
- Supporting data (measurements, certificates)
- Explanation of the security guarantees

## Security Best Practices

### Mr. TEE's Security Rules

1. **Never expose private keys** - Keep them in the TEE
2. **Always verify attestation** - Trust but verify
3. **Use secure channels** - Encrypt all communications
4. **Audit regularly** - Check for vulnerabilities
5. **Stay paranoid** - It's not paranoia if they're really after your keys
6. **Rotate API keys regularly** - Fresh keys, fresh security
7. **Never commit `.env` files** - Secrets stay secret

### TEE Guarantees

- **Isolated Execution**: Code runs in hardware-protected memory
- **Memory Encryption**: All data encrypted in RAM
- **Remote Attestation**: Cryptographic proof of execution environment
- **Secure Key Storage**: Keys never leave the enclave
- **Tamper Resistance**: Hardware protection against physical attacks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "I can't deploy my Agent"

- Sign up for a Phala Cloud account at <https://dashboard.phala.network>
- Add credits to your account for CVM deployments
- Ensure Docker is running and you're logged in

#### "Docker deployment failed"

- Ensure Docker Desktop is started
- Check: `docker ps`
- Make sure to authenticate: `docker login`
- Check your configuration and try to test docker locally

#### "Authentication failed"

- Verify your Phala API key
- Re-run: `elizaos tee phala auth login`
- Check API key from Phala Dashboard

#### "Build failures"

- Check your `.env` configuration
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `bun install`
- Verify Docker is running properly

#### "Attestation failed"

- Check TEE_MODE is set to PRODUCTION if deployed to Phala Cloud
- Verify network connectivity for attestation services
- Ensure proper TEE initialization
- Check CVM logs in Phala Dashboard

#### "Missing API keys"

- All required environment variables must be set
- Check .env file formatting
- Restart after configuration changes

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check environment
bun run test

# Verify TEE service
docker logs [container_name] | grep TEE

# Test attestation locally
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Monitoring Your Deployment

- View CVM status: <https://dashboard.phala.network>
- Check attestation reports regularly
- Monitor resource usage and adjust if needed
- Set up alerts for critical events

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Security Policies

Mr. TEE enforces strict security through his character configuration:

- Paranoid validation of all inputs
- Aggressive security recommendations
- No tolerance for weak cryptography

### Multi-TEE Support

The plugin-tee supports multiple TEE vendors:

- **Phala Network**: Cloud-based TEE with easy deployment
- **Intel TDX**: Hardware-based security for on-premise
- **Development Mode**: Simulated TEE for testing

### Production Hardening

1. Enable all security features in TEE_MODE
2. Configure proper attestation verification
3. Set up monitoring and alerting
4. Regular security audits
